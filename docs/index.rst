===================================
Welcome to BuildAMol's documentation
===================================

`BuildAMol` is a fragment-based molecular assembly toolkit for the generation of atomic models for medium to large chemical compounds.
It is designed to leverage the simplicity of python-coding and the power of fragment-based assembly to generate 3D structures of molecules.
Based on `biopython <http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ and accessible as a `python package`, `BuildAMol` not only offers a 
simple and versatile API to generate, manipulate, visualize, and export 3D structures of molecules, but also provides easy interfaces
with other molecular modeling tools such as `OpenBabel <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ and `RDKit <https://www.rdkit.org/docs/index.html>`_.
