The Extensions
==============

BuildAMol comes with a number of extensions that offer more applied functionalities to particular use cases. 
The extensions are not loaded by default, but can be loaded by importing the respective modules and packages.

.. note::

    The extensions are designed as an open hub for the community to contribute to. If you have an idea for an extension,
    feel free to develop something and submit a pull request to the `BuildAMol GitHub repository <https://github.com/NoahHenrikKleinschmidt/buildamol>`_.
