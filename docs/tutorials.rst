.. card:: Getting Started
   :link: example_getting_started
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers the fundamentals of buildamol. It is slightly more detailed than the "Basic Usage" page, however, and covers topics that the other tutorials elaborate on.


.. card:: A typical workflow
   :link: example_building_workflow
   :link-type: ref

   In this tutorial we will build a molecule to get the hang of a "typical" BuildAMol workflow.


.. card:: Syntax Flavors
   :link: example_syntax
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers the different syntax flavors that BuildAMol supports.


.. card:: Visualizing Molecules
   :link: example_visualizing_molecules
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers how to visualize molecules using buildamol.


.. card:: Optimizing Molecules
   :link: example_optimization
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers how to optimize molecular conformations in buildamol.


.. card:: Other Libraries and Formats
   :link: example_converting_formats
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers how to convert between different file formats and how to use other libraries with buildamol.


Resource-oriented Tutorials
---------------------------

.. card:: Built-in Resources
   :link: example_built_in_resources
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers how to use the built-in resources of buildamol.

.. card:: Adding Resources
   :link: example_defaults
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers how to add your own resources to BuildAMol so they are available to all your projects.


More applied Tutorials
----------------------

.. card:: Building circular Molecules
   :link: example_building_circular
   :link-type: ref

   This tutorial covers how to build circular molecules in BuildAMol together with RDKit.

.. card:: Building Polyphenylene
   :link: example_building_polyphenylene
   :link-type: ref

   In this tutorial we will build a polyphenylene dendrimer using some automization.

.. card:: Molecular Dynamics
   :link: example_md
   :link-type: ref

   In this tutorial we will build a molecule and run a molecular dynamics simulation on it.

.. card:: Conformation Sampling
   :link: example_conformation_sampling
   :link-type: ref

   In this tutorial we will generate multiple conformers of a molecule using BuildAMol's optimization methods.

.. card:: Building a Rotaxane - Multi-Molecule System
   :link: example_multisystem
   :link-type: ref

   In this tutorial we will build a multi-molecule system using BuildAMol. Specifically, we will build a rotaxane.

.. card:: Building a Solvation Box
   :link: example_solvationbox
   :link-type: ref

   In this tutorial we will build a solvation box around a molecule using BuildAMol.
