   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Basic Usage
===========

Most of the functionality is provided through a simple toplevel functional API, with a much more extended
method-based API available for both simple and more complex operations. To facilitate user-friendliness most of the 
BuildAMol functionality has been integrated into methods that are attached to the `Molecule` class, which is the
main class of BuildAMol. The `Molecule` class is a wrapper around the `Bio.PDB.Structure.Structure` class which handles
all atomic data. 

.. note::

   The `Molecule` class is **not** a subclass of `Bio.PDB.Structure.Structure` - it is a wrapper around it. This means that
   it does not inherit any methods of the `Structure` class directly. However, the `Molecule` class has a `structure` attribute
   which is the `Structure` object that it wraps. Also, the `Molecule` class is equipped with many equivalent methods to the `Structure`
   class that can be used to access the structure in more convenient ways.

The `Molecule` class is the main class of BuildAMol and is used to create, modify, and visualize molecular structures. The `Molecule` class can:

- read structures from PDB and mmCIF files
- write structures to PDB and mmCIF files
- convert structural data between formats
- add and remove atoms, residues, and chains
- rotate parts of the structure around bonds
- connect multiple molecules together
- visualize structures in 3D
- provide structural data such as bond angles

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam

   # make a molecule from a PDB file
   mol = bam.molecule("my_structure.pdb")

   # rotate part of the molecule 
   # around the bond between atoms C4 and C5 by 45Â°
   # rotating only atoms after C5 (i.e. descendants)
   mol.rotate_around_bond("C4", "C5", 45, descendants_only=True)

   # write the molecule to a mmCIF file
   mol.to_cif("my_structure.cif")


.. admonition:: Did you know?

   The toplevel ``molecule`` function can be fed with a variety of inputs and will automatically try to discern the correct processing
   in order to produce a ``Molecule`` object. Namely, the following inputs are all valid:

   - a PDB or CIF filename
   - a PDB id
   - a molecule name (e.g. "alpha-d-glucose")
   - a SMILES string
   - an InChI string or key
   - a `Structure` object from `Bio.PDB`
   - an `openbabel.OBMol` object
   - an `rdkit.Chem.Mol` object

Functional API
--------------

The toplevel functional API is the most straightforward one, and is for many operations the easiest one.
Functions such as ``read_pdb`` or ``polymerize`` are intuitive and easy to use. However, the functional API is 
not as extensive as the method-based API, since it simply calls the method-based API under the hood. Many other 
operations are therefore not available in the functional API - for instance, removing atoms from a molecule is only available
in the method-based API.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam

   # load sugar data repository
   bam.load_sugars()

   # make a molecule from a 
   # defined chemical compound
   glc = bam.molecule("alpha-d-glucose")

   # polymerize the glucose molecule
   # to make cellulose
   cellulose = bam.polymerize(glc, 100, linkage="14bb")

   # write the cellulose to a PDB file
   bam.write_pdb(cellulose, "cellulose.pdb")


Method-based API
----------------

The method-based API allows for more flexibility. At the heart of BuildAMol is the `Molecule` class, which
has a great number of methods to modify the structure or add/remove parts of it. Methods such as ``get_atom``,
``add_bond``, or ``remove_residue`` are basic operations to modify a structure in-place, while methods such as ``attach``
allow to expand the structure by adding new parts to it.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam
   bam.load_sugars()

   # make a molecule from a 
   # defined chemical compound
   glc = bam.Molecule.from_compound("alpha-d-glucose")

   # polymerize the glucose molecule
   # to make cellulose
   cellulose = glc.repeat(100, linkage="14bb")

   # write the cellulose to a PDB file
   cellulose.to_pdb("cellulose.pdb")

Operator-based API
------------------

The operator-based API is a short-hand proxy to the method-based API (just as the functional API is a proxy).
It is essentially restricted to operations that regard connecting two molecules together. However, it is the most
condensed way to write BuildAMol code - sometimes at the expense of readability. Available operators are:

- `+` for connecting two molecules together
- `*` for polymerizing a molecule
- `%` for specifying the linkage between two molecules
- `@` for specifying the residue at which to create a connection between two molecules
- `^` for specifying the atom to use for a connection (more detailed than `@`)

.. note::

   In-place versions of the operators are also available, e.g. `+=` for connecting two molecules in-place, or `*=` for in-place polymerization.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam
   bam.load_sugars()

   glc = bam.Molecule.from_compound("alpha-d-glucose")

   # polymerize the glucose molecule into cellulose
   cellulose = glc % "14bb" * 100

   # write the cellulose to a PDB file
   cellulose.to_pdb("cellulose.pdb")



Built-in-resources
==================

BuildAMol comes with a number of built-in data resources. Namely, BuildAMol integrates the `PDBE component library <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdb-component-library/#:~:text=The%20PDB%20Component%20Library%20is,and%20related%20protein%20structural%20data.>`_ for
components up to 40 atoms in size by default - naturally, the full library can be loaded if desired. This enables molecule creation through the ``from_compounds`` method that can be queried using `PDB id`, `chemical name`, `SMILES`, `InChI` and `InChIKey`.
Furthermore, BuildAMol integrates parts of the `CHARMM force field <https://www.charmm.org/>`_ for
references of molecular connections. You may have noticed that in the above examples, the `1->4 beta` glycosyidic linkage was used a lot, but only referred to as ``"14bb"``.
This is because the CHARMM force field has the geometric data stored under this identifier. 
Finally, BuildAMol integrates `pubchempy` for the direct retrieval of molecules from PubChem (requires internet connection).

Toplevel functions exist to access these resources, e.g. ``buildamol.available_linkages()`` to get a list of pre-defined linkages,
or ``buildamol.has_compound("alpha-mannose")`` to check if a particular compound is available in the loaded PDBE component library. Also,
in order to make BuildAMol more useful to the respective user, it is possible to add custom data to the standard resources and set new default settings 
using functions such as ``set_default_topology`` or ``add_linkage``. 


Example
=======

Building a simple polymer
-------------------------

Let's make a simple polymer with a repeating unit composed of a benzene ring and two amino acids, glycine and tyrosine.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam

   # first we load some reference data
   # (not necessary but makes getting the molecules 
   # quicker, since we don't need to query PubChem)
   bam.load_small_molecules()
   bam.load_amino_acids()  

   benzene = bam.molecule("benzene")
   glycine = bam.molecule("glycine")
   tyrosine = bam.molecule("tyrosine")


   # now we can connect the molecules together
   # we start by defining how we want to connect the benzene
   # ring to the amino acid tyrosine
   link = bam.linkage("C1", "N") # = connect C1 from benzene to N from tyrosine
   mol = benzene.attach(tyrosine, link1)

   # now we can add a glycine to the molecule
   link.atom1 = "C3" # just re-use the link object but change the target atom
   mol = mol.attach(glycine, link, at_residue=1) # at_residue=1 means we always attach to the first residue (=benzene)

   # now we can polymerize the molecule
   
   # we make a new linkage (luckily there are only two atoms with names C5 and OH so we don't have
   # to worry about specifying which residues to connect exactly)
   # let's use a for-loop to automate the process
   link2 = bam.linkage("C5", "OH")
   _mol = mol.copy()
   for i in range(10):
      mol = mol.attach(_mol, link2)
   
   # fun fact: we could have just used
   # mol = mol.repeat(10, link2)

   # now that we have the molecule we can perform some quick
   # optimization on it
   mol = mol.optimize()

   # and finally visualize it
   mol.show()

Building a glycan
-----------------

BuildAMol was originally conceptualized with the aim of creating glycan structures - so, in the example let's make a glycan. The following example demonstrates
how we can create a larger structure from single monosaccharides using BuildAMol. We are also going to showcase the three different syntaxes that can be used to achieve this.
Note, if you want to build glycans specifically, you should check out `Glycosylator`, which is a glycan-specific extension of BuildAMol!

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam

   bam.load_sugars()

   # get the monosaccharides
   # (using their PDBE identifiers)
   nag = bam.molecule("NAG") # N-acetylglucosamine, a.k.a. GlcNAc
   bma = bam.molecule("BMA") # beta-mannose
   man = bam.molecule("MAN") # alpha-mannose

   # start by connecting two NAGs together
   # 'beta 1->4' glycosydic linkage is pre-defined
   # in the CHARMM force field and can be used by its name '14bb' directly
   glycan = nag % "14bb" + nag

   # add a beta-mannose to the last NAG
   glycan += bma

   # add an alpha-mannose to the beta-mannose
   # using an 'alpha 1->3' linkage ('13ab' in CHARMM)
   glycan.attach(man, "13ab")

   # add another alpha-mannose
   # at the second-to-last residue (BMA)
   glycan.attach(man, "16ab", at_residue=-2)

   # add one final alpha-mannose
   glycan = bam.connect(glycan, man, "16ab")

   # now visualise the structure
   glycan.show()

.. image:: _resources/glycan_example.gif
   :width: 80%
   :align: center
   :alt: Example glycan structure.

In the above visualization, `NAG` residues are colored in pink, `BMA` in orange, and `MAN` in green. Hetero-atoms are colored according to IUPAC conventions.

The above example demonstrates how we can use BuildAMol to create a glycan structure from scratch. The example also demonstrates how we can use the three different syntaxes
to achieve this. Using the toplevel function `connect`, using the method `attach`, or by simple "molecular arithmetics" through the `+` operator.
