   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Basic Usage
===========

Most of the functionality is provided through a simple toplevel functional API, with a much more extended
method-based API available for both simple and more complex operations. To facilitate user-friendliness most of the 
`biobuild` functionality has been integrated into methods that are attached to the `Molecule` class, which is the
main class of `biobuild`. The `Molecule` class is a wrapper around the `Bio.PDB.Structure.Structure` class which handles
all atomic data. 

.. note::

   The `Molecule` class is **not** a subclass of `Bio.PDB.Structure.Structure` - it is a wrapper around it. This means that
   it does not inherit any methods of the `Structure` class directly. However, the `Molecule` class has a `structure` attribute
   which is the `Structure` object that it wraps. Also, the `Molecule` class is equipped with many equivalent methods to the `Structure`
   class that can be used to access the structure in more convenient ways.

The `Molecule` class is the main class of `biobuild` and is used to create, modify, and visualize molecular structures. The `Molecule` class can:

- read structures from PDB and mmCIF files
- write structures to PDB and mmCIF files
- convert structural data between formats
- add and remove atoms, residues, and chains
- rotate parts of the structure around bonds
- connect multiple molecules together
- visualize structures in 3D
- provide structural data such as bond angles

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam

   # make a molecule from a PDB file
   mol = bam.molecule("my_structure.pdb")

   # rotate part of the molecule 
   # around the bond between atoms C4 and C5 by 45Â°
   # rotating only atoms after C5 (i.e. descendants)
   mol.rotate_around_bond("C4", "C5", 45, descendants_only=True)

   # write the molecule to a mmCIF file
   mol.to_cif("my_structure.cif")


.. admonition:: Did you know?

   The toplevel ``molecule`` function can be fed with a variety of inputs and will automatically try to discern the correct processing
   in order to produce a ``Molecule`` object. Namely, the following inputs are all valid:

   - a PDB or CIF filename
   - a PDB id
   - a molecule name (e.g. "alpha-d-glucose")
   - a SMILES string
   - an InChI string or key
   - a `Structure` object from `Bio.PDB`

Functional API
--------------

The toplevel functional API is the most straightforward one, and is for many operations the easiest one.
Functions such as ``read_pdb`` or ``polymerize`` are intuitive and easy to use. However, the functional API is 
not as extensive as the method-based API, since it simply calls the method-based API under the hood. Many other 
operations are therefore not available in the functional API - for instance, removing atoms from a molecule is only available
in the method-based API.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam

   # load sugar data repository
   bam.load_sugars()

   # make a molecule from a 
   # defined chemical compound
   glc = bam.molecule("alpha-d-glucose")

   # polymerize the glucose molecule
   # to make cellulose
   cellulose = bam.polymerize(glc, 100, linkage="14bb")

   # write the cellulose to a PDB file
   bam.write_pdb(cellulose, "cellulose.pdb")


Method-based API
----------------

The method-based API allows for more flexibility. At the heart of `biobuild` is the `Molecule` class, which
has a great number of methods to modify the structure or add/remove parts of it. Methods such as ``get_atom``,
``add_bond``, or ``remove_residue`` are basic operations to modify a structure in-place, while methods such as ``attach``
allow to expand the structure by adding new parts to it.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam
   bam.load_sugars()

   # make a molecule from a 
   # defined chemical compound
   glc = bam.Molecule.from_compound("alpha-d-glucose")

   # polymerize the glucose molecule
   # to make cellulose
   cellulose = glc.repeat(100, linkage="14bb")

   # write the cellulose to a PDB file
   cellulose.to_pdb("cellulose.pdb")

Operator-based API
------------------

The operator-based API is a short-hand proxy to the method-based API (just as the functional API is a proxy).
It is essentially restricted to operations that regard connecting two molecules together. However, it is the most
condensed way to write `biobuild` code - sometimes at the expense of readability. Available operators are:

- `+` for connecting two molecules together
- `*` for polymerizing a molecule
- `%` for specifying the linkage between two molecules
- `@` for specifying the residue at which to create a connection between two molecules
- `^` for specifying the atom to use for a connection (more detailed than `@`)

.. note::

   In-place versions of the operators are also available, e.g. `+=` for connecting two molecules in-place, or `*=` for in-place polymerization.

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam
   bam.load_sugars()

   glc = bam.Molecule.from_compound("alpha-d-glucose")

   # polymerize the glucose molecule into cellulose
   cellulose = glc % "14bb" * 100

   # write the cellulose to a PDB file
   cellulose.to_pdb("cellulose.pdb")



Built-in-resources
==================

`biobuild` comes with a number of built-in data resources. Namely, `biobuild` integrates the `PDBE component library <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdb-component-library/#:~:text=The%20PDB%20Component%20Library%20is,and%20related%20protein%20structural%20data.>`_ for
components up to 40 atoms in size by default - naturally, the full library can be loaded if desired. This enables molecule creation through the ``from_compounds`` method that can be queried using `PDB id`, `chemical name`, `SMILES`, `InChI` and `InChIKey`.
Furthermore, `biobuild` integrates parts of the `CHARMM force field <https://www.charmm.org/>`_ for
references of molecular connections. You may have noticed that in the above examples, the `1->4 beta` glycosyidic linkage was used a lot, but only referred to as ``"14bb"``.
This is because the CHARMM force field has the geometric data stored under this identifier. 
Finally, `biobuild` integrates `pubchempy` for the direct retrieval of molecules from PubChem (requires internet connection).

Toplevel functions exist to access these resources, e.g. ``buildamol.available_linkages()`` to get a list of pre-defined linkages,
or ``buildamol.has_compound("alpha-mannose")`` to check if a particular compound is available in the loaded PDBE component library. Also,
in order to make `biobuild` more useful to the respective user, it is possible to add custom data to the standard resources and set new default settings 
using functions such as ``set_default_topology`` or ``add_linkage``. 


Example
=======

Building a glycan
-----------------

`biobuild` was originally conceptualized with the aim of creating glycan structures - so, please, forgive if the example below produces a glycan. The following example demonstrates
how we can create a larger structure from single monosaccharides using `biobuild` (using all three syntaxes intermixed):

.. code-block:: python

   import buildamol as bam
   bam.load_sugars()

   # get the monosaccharides
   # (using their PDBE identifiers)
   nag = bam.molecule("NAG") # N-acetylglucosamine, a.k.a. GlcNAc
   bma = bam.molecule("BMA") # beta-mannose
   man = bam.molecule("MAN") # alpha-mannose

   # start by connecting two NAGs together
   # 'beta 1->4' glycosydic linkage is pre-defined
   # in the CHARMM force field and can be used by its name '14bb' directly
   glycan = nag % "14bb" + nag

   # add a beta-mannose to the last NAG
   glycan += bma

   # add an alpha-mannose to the beta-mannose
   # using an 'alpha 1->3' linkage ('13ab' in CHARMM)
   glycan.attach(man, "13ab")

   # add another alpha-mannose
   # at the second-to-last residue (BMA)
   glycan.attach(man, "16ab", at_residue=-2)

   # add one final alpha-mannose
   glycan = bam.connect(glycan, man, "16ab")

   # now visualise the structure
   glycan.show()
.. image:: _resources/glycan_example.gif

   :alt: Example glycan structure.

In the above visualization, `NAG` residues are colored in pink, `BMA` in orange, and `MAN` in green. Hetero-atoms are colored according to IUPAC conventions.

The above example demonstrates how we can use `biobuild` to create a glycan structure from scratch. The example also demonstrates how we can use the three different syntaxes
to achieve this. Using the toplevel function `connect`, using the method `attach`, or by simple "molecular arithmetics" through the `+` operator.
