"""
The `Molecule` class is a wrapper around a biopython structure and a core part 
of BuildAMol functionality. It provides a convenient interface to molecular structures
and their properties, such as atoms, bonds, residues, chains, etc. 

.. note:: 

    To help with identifying individual atoms, residues, etc. BuildAMol uses a different identification scheme than biopython does.
    Therefore BuildAMol comes with its own child classes of the biopython classes
    that are used to represent the structure. These classes are called `Atom`, `Residue`, `Chain`, etc.
    and can be used as drop-in replacements for the biopython classes and should not break any existing code.
    However, in case any incompatibility is observed anyway, the classes are equipped with a `to_biopython` method
    that will remove the BuildAMol overhead and return pure biopython objects (this is not an in-place operation, however,
    and will return a new object). 


Making Molecules
================

The easiest way to make a new molecule is to use the toplevel `molecule` function, which will automatically
try to detect the type of user provided input and generate a molecule from it. Currently supported inputs are:
- A biopython structure
- An RDKit molecule
- An OpenBabel molecule
- An OpenMM topology
- An STK molecule
- A PDB id
- A PDB file
- A CIF file
- A MOL file
- A JSON file
- An XML file
- A SMILES string
- An InChI string
- An IUPAC name or abbreviation, or any name that matches a known compound synonym that is associated with the PubChem database

.. code-block:: python

    from buildamol import molecule

    my_glucose = molecule("GLC") # use the PDB id

    # or
    my_glucose = molecule("GLC.pdb") # use the PDB file

    # or
    my_glucose = molecule("alpha-d-glucose") # use the name

    # ...

Since the `molecule` function is a try-and-error function it is convenient but not the most efficient. Hence, the `Molecule` class
offers already a number of convenient methods to easily generate molecules directly from specified data sources. Available methods are:

- `Molecule.from_pdb` to generate a molecule from a PDB file
- `Molecule.from_cif` to generate a molecule from a CIF file
- `Molecule.from_smiles` to generate a molecule from a SMILES string
- `Molecule.from_pubchem` to generate a molecule from a PubChem entry
- `Molecule.from_compound` to generate a molecule from a PDBECompounds entry
- `Molecule.from_rdkit` to generate a molecule from an RDKit molecule object
- `Molecule.from_openmm` to generate a molecule from an OpenMM topology object
- `Molecule.from_stk` to generate a molecule from an STK molecule object
- `Molecule.from_molfile` to generate a molecule from a MOL file
- `Molecule.from_json` to generate a molecule from a JSON file
- `Molecule.from_xml` to generate a molecule from an XML file
- `Molecule.empty` to generate an empty molecule


Hence, if we know that "glucose" is already available in our local PDBECompounds database, we can generate the molecule also as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from buildamol import Molecule

    my_glucose = Molecule.from_compound("GLC") # use the PDB id


The quickest way to query the local PDBECompounds database is to use the `PDB Id` of the desired compounds.
However, the `from_compound` accepts other inputs as well. The database is queried using the `by` parameter, which can be one of the following:
- "id" for the PDB id (default)
- "name" for the name of the compound (must match any known synonym of the iupac name)
- "formula" for the chemical formula (usually ambiguous and will therefore often raise an error)
- "smiles" for the SMILES string (also accepts InChI)

.. code-block:: python

    # create a new glucose molecule
    glc = Molecule.from_compound("alpha-d-glucose", by="name") # use the name


Saving Molecules
----------------
If a molecule is created from a large PDB file and has undergone a lot of preprocessing, it may be useful to `save` the molecule to a pickle file
which can be loaded again later to avoid repeated preprocessing. This can be done using the `save` and `load` methods.

.. code-block:: python

    # save the molecule to a pickle file
    my_molecule.save("my_molecule.pkl")

    # load the molecule from the pickle file
    my_molecule = Molecule.load("my_molecule.pkl")

    

Modifying Molecules
===================

Once a molecule is created, it can be modified in a number of ways. The most common modifications are
- adding bonds (because when loading from a PDB file, bonds are not inferred automatically!)
- adding additional residues and atoms
- removing residues and atoms
- adjusting labelling (e.g. changing the chain names and residue seqids)

Adding bonds
------------

To add a bond between two atoms, we use the `add_bond` method, which expects two arguments for the two connected atoms.
The atoms can be specified by their `full_id` tuple, their `id` string, their `serial_number` (always starting at 1) or directly (the `biopython.Atom` object).

.. code-block:: python

    glc = Molecule.from_compound("GLC")

    # add a bond between the first and second atom
    glc.add_bond(1, 2)

    # and also add a bond between "O1" and "HO1" atoms
    glc.add_bond("O1", "HO1")


Already for small molecules such as glucose with only 24 atoms, it would be very tedious to add all bonds manually. Good thing that the molecules
created using `from_compound` or `from_pdb` already contain all the default bonds!

However, in case the bonds are missing, or the PDB file did not specify any to begin with, the `Molecule` class offers two methods: `apply_standard_bonds` and `infer_bonds`. 
The former uses reference connectivity information from the PDBECompounds database or CHARMMTopology to add all bonds that are known for the compound (if it exists in the database).
The latter will use a simple distance-based approach to infer bonds between atoms that are closer than a specified threshold (default: 1.6 Å), which can be restricted
further to a min-max window.

.. code-block:: python

    # add all standard bonds for Glucose
    glc.apply_standard_bonds()

    # add all bonds that are closer than 1.6 Å
    glc.infer_bonds(bond_length=1.6)

    # add all bonds that are closer than 1.6 Å, but not closer than 1.0 Å
    glc.infer_bonds(bond_length=(1.0, 1.6))


.. note::

    By default `infer_bonds` will not attempt to add bonds between atoms that belong to different residues.
    This is because in cases of suboptimal conformations or in very large structures atoms that are close in space may not be connected in the structure.
    To override this behaviour, set the `restrict_residues` parameter to `False`.

    .. code-block:: python

        # add all bonds that are closer than 1.6 Å, even if they belong to different residues
        glc.infer_bonds(bond_length=1.6, restrict_residues=False)

        
Residue Connections
-------------------

Alternatively, instead of `infer_bonds` one may use `infer_residue_connections` to get bonds that connect different residues.
This method will infer all bonds between atoms from different residues based on the distance between them. The inferred bonds are
saved in the `Molecule` and also returned in a `list`. If the optional argument `triplet` is set to `True`, the methodd will also
return the bonds immediately adjacent to the inferred bonds.

Take the following example of a molecule with two residues `A` and `B` that are connected by a bond between `OA` and `(1)CB`:

.. code-block:: text    

     connection -->  OA     OB --- H
                    /  \\   /
     (1)CA --- (2)CA   (1)CB 
        /         \\        \\
    (6)CA         (3)CA    (2)CB --- (3)CB
        \\         /
     (5)CA --- (4)CA
 
     
If `triplet=False` the method will only return the bond between `OA` and `(1)CB`. However, if `triplet=True` it will also return the bond
between `(2)CA` and `OA` - thus forming a triplet of atoms `(2)CA`, `OA` and `(1)CB` that connect the two residues A and B.

.. code-block:: python

    # infer all bonds between atoms from different residues
    >>> glc.infer_residue_connections(triplet=False)
    [(OA, (1)CB)]
    >>> glc.infer_residue_connections(triplet=True)
    [(OA, (1)CB), ((2)CA, OA)]
    


Adding residues and atoms
-------------------------

To add one or more new residue(s), we use the `add_residues` method, which expects a number `buildamol.Residue` objects as unnamed arguments.
Similarly, to add one or more new atom(s), we use the `add_atoms` method, which expects a number of `buildamol.Atom` objects as unnamed arguments.
Both methods allow to specify the parent object (`chain` or `residue`) via an optional argument and will automatically choose the last
chain or residue if none is specified.

.. code-block:: python

    from buildamol import Residue, Atom

    new_residue = Residue("XYZ", 1, " ")
    
    # do things with the residue here
    # ...

    # add the residue to the molecule
    # (add it to the last chain, whichever that may be)
    glc.add_residues(new_residue)

    new_atom = Atom("X", [0, 0, 0])

    # add the atom to the first residue in the `glc` molecule
    glc.add_atoms(new_atom, residue=1)

Removing residues and atoms
---------------------------

In order to remove residues or atoms or bonds, we can use the `remove_residues`, `remove_atoms` and `remove_bond`(yes, singluar!) methods.
They work exactly like their `add_` counterparts, but instead of adding, they remove the specified objects.

.. code-block:: python

    # remove the first residue
    glc.remove_residues(1)

    # remove the first atom
    glc.remove_atoms(1)

    # remove the bond between the first and second atom
    glc.remove_bond(1, 2)


Adjusting labelling
-------------------

Single-residue molecules that were loaded from a PDB file may not use the same atom labelling as the `PDBE` and `CHARMM` databases.
In order to quickly adjust the labelling, a method `autolabel` exists. `autolabel` uses the atom connectivity and a rule-based algorithm to infer 
the most likely atom labels. However, since this method is not perfect, it is recommended to check the labelling afterwards and adjust it manually if necessary.

If working with large molecules that follow another labelling scheme it may be more efficient to simply
define your own linkage recipies or patches (see the documentation of `linkages`) that use the the appropriate labelling scheme.

.. code-block:: python

    # load a molecule from a PDB file
    glc = Molecule.from_pdb("glucose.pdb")

    # adjust the labelling
    glc.autolabel()

    # save the molecule to a new PDB file
    glc.to_pdb("glucose_autolabelled.pdb")


Another common operation is the adjustment of chain names and residue seqids. This can be done using the `reindex` method.
This method accepts three starting values for the chain name, residue seqid and atom serial number and will then reindex all chains, residues and atoms
to ensure they are continuously numbered and labelled. Some internal methods used when connecting different molecules are reliant on a continuous
numbering scheme, so this method should be called before connecting molecules that were loaded from PDB files.

.. code-block:: python

    # load a molecule from a PDB file
    glc = Molecule.from_pdb("glucose.pdb")

    # reindex the molecule
    glc.reindex()

We can also use one molecule as a "reference" for reindexing another molecule to make sure there are now labelling conflicts between them in case we want to connect them together later (this is usually done internally by BuildAMol automatically).

.. code-block:: python  

    # load a molecule from a PDB file
    glc = Molecule.from_pdb("glucose.pdb")

    # load another molecule from a PDB file
    cel = Molecule.from_pdb("cellulose.pdb")
    cel.reindex() # make sure we have a continuous numbering scheme

    # reindex the glucose molecule using the cellulose molecule as a reference
    cel.adjust_indexing(glc)



Connecting Molecules
====================

Since most modifications are not simply single residues but rather complex structures, the second main purpose of a `Molecule` is to be easily 
connected to other Molecules to form a larger structure. To this end, the `Molecule` class provides a number of methods to easily assemble complex structures from small single residue molecules.


Forming Polymers
----------------

The simplest way to generate a large structure is probably the `repeat` method, which will repeat the given molecule `n` times
to form a homo-polymer.

.. code-block:: python

    # create a glucose molecule
    glc = Molecule.from_compound("GLC")

    # create cellulose from glucose
    # using a 1-4 beta-beta glycosidic linkage
    # which is pre-defined in the default CHARMMTopology
    glc.repeat(10, "14bb")

    # Now we have a cellulose of 10 glucoses

In the above example we used the `repeat` method explicitly, but we could also achieve the same with the short-hand `*=`. For this to work, we need to specify 
the linkage type beforehand. We do this by setting the `patch` attribute before using any operator.

.. code-block:: python

    # specify the "default" linkage type for connecting 
    # other molecules to this glucose
    glc.linkage = "14bb"

    # now make a cellulose by multiplying glucoses
    glc *= 20

    # Now we have a cellulose of 20 glucoses

    
If we wish to keep `glc` as a single residue Glucose and still get our desired cellulose, 
we can set `inplace=False` when calling `repeat` or simply use the `*` operator, both of which 
will have the same effect of creating a new copy that houses the appropriate residues.

.. code-block:: python

    cel = glc.repeat(10, "14bb", inplace=False)

    # or (equivalently)
    glc.patch = "14bb"
    cel = glc * 10


    
Connecting different Molecules
------------------------------

What if we want to connect different molecules? For example, we may want to connect a Galactose to a Glucose to form Lactose.
This can be achieved using the `attach` method, which will attach a given molecule to to another molecule.

.. code-block:: python

    glc = Molecule.from_compound("GLC")
    gal = Molecule.from_compound("GAL")

    # attach the galactose to the glucose
    # (we want a copy, so we set inplace=False just like with 'repeat')
    lac = glc.attach(gal, "14bb", inplace=False)

    # Now we have a lactose molecule


In the above example, the `attach` method is used to attach the galactose molecule to the glucose, but for those
among us who prefer a more shorty syntax, the `+` operator will do the same thing. 

.. code-block:: python

    # specify that incoming molecules shall be
    # attached using a 1-4 beta linkage
    glc.linkage = "14bb"

    # now attach the galactose to the glucose
    lac = glc + gal


Of course, if there is a `+` operator there should also be a `+=` operator, which is simply the equivalent of `attach` with `inplace=True`.

.. code-block:: python

    glc.linkage = "14bb"
    glc += gal


    # Now 'glc' is a lactose molecule


Setting default Modifiers
-------------------------

So far, we have always worked with a 1-4 beta-beta glycosidic linkage, which we apparently could select using the string `"14bb"`. 
But what if we want to use a different linkage type? For example, a 1-4 alpha-beta glycosidic linkage?  You of course noticed, 
that `attach` and `repeat` accept an argument `link` which allows you to specify the linkage type, and that if you leave it blank
the default linkage type is used. But how do we set the default linkage type?

Let's first check what linkage types are available by default anyway. Have you noticed an argument named `_topology`
at the end of the `attach` or `repeat` methods? The `topology` refers to the underlying _CHARMM_ topology which hosts the linkage type information.
By default a topology is already loaded in BuildAMol's framework so it is not necessary for the user to specify anything here, but we can check which linkage types are available by:

.. code-block:: python

    import buildamol as bam

    # get the default topology
    topology = bam.get_default_topology()

    print(topology.patches)


Any of these linkages can be referenced by their name, e.g. `"14bb"` or `"14ab"`. 

Wait a second, my desired linkage is not in the list! What now?! Well, you can always define a new `Linkage` to suit your needs.
Check out the documentation on :ref:`linkages` for more information on how to do this. If you have your desired linkage 
ready to go, set it as the default by:

.. code-block:: python

    my_molecule.linkage = my_linkage
    
    # or if you feel "super correct"
    my_molecule.set_linkage(my_linkage)

    # or if you feel "extra cocky"
    my_molecule % my_linkage # <- the modulo operator assignes the "modifier" to the molecule


Now any call to `attach`, `repeat`, or any of its operator proxies will use your defined linkage by default.

Setting the default Residue for attachment
------------------------------------------

When defining a `Linkage` we specify which atoms are supposed to be connected and removed, but we do not specify which residues
these atoms belong to. We specify this as arguments inside the `attach` method for instance, but we can also leave this blank, in which case the
last residue in the molecule is used by default. This is obviously not always what we want, however! Hence, if we do not want to specify the residue for attachment
at every `attach` call or if we want to use the `+` operator, we can set the default residue for attachment by setting the `attach_residue` attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    # set the default attachment residue to the first residue
    my_molecule.attach_residue = 1

    # or
    my_molecule.set_attach_residue(1)

    # or (if you feel "extra cocky")
    my_molecule @ 1 # <- the 'at' operator sets the attachment residue


    # serial number indexing also works in reverse
    # (set the second last residue as the default attachment residue)
    my_molecule.attach_residue = -2
