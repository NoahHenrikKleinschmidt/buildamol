"""
The OverlapRotatron is a environment that approximates molecular graphs using multi-variat Gaussian distributions. The overlap between the distributions is used as the evaluation function for the environment.
Hence, this environment tries to minimize the overlap between distributions in order to find favorable conformations.

As measure for the overlap between two distributions, the Jensen-Shannon divergence is used by default. Custom overlap functions can be passed to the environment.

    artificial_spread : float
        The spread to use for the multi-variate normal distributions. This is used to artificially increase the spread of the distributions.
        This is useful for cases where the distributions may be too tight and far apart which makes it difficult for the overlap to be computed.

    crop_nodes_further_than : float
        If greater than 0, crop nodes that are further than this distance from the
        rotatable edges so that they are not considered in the overlap calculation.
    distance_function : callable
        A specific distance function to use for calculating the overlap. This function
        should take two arrays of shape (1, 3) (centers) and two arrays of shape (3, 3) (covariances)
        and return a scalar.
    ignore_further_than : float
        If greater than 0, centroids that are further than this distance from each other are evaluated as 0 overlap automatically.
    n_processes : int
        The number of parallel processes to use when computing edge masks.
